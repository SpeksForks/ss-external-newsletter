External Newsletter
======
**External Newsletter** syncs your database to an external newsletter provider.

It is very basic at the moment. **Use with caution**

## TODO
* Queue support (so user is not sitting their waiting for syncs to finish)
* Support for IndieWeb (everything stored on SS side as well as off-site)

## Install
Add the following to your composer.json file

```

    "require"          : {
		"milkyway-multimedia/ss-external-newsletter": "dev-master"
	}
	
```

### Configuration

Don't forget to set your api key as well.

```

    EmailCampaigns:
      api_key: ''

```
